      Aries is the first sign of the zodiac (a belt of the heavens, including all apparent positions
      of the sun, moon, and most familiar planets).

      Those born under this sign are often called the pioneers of
        zodiac, and it is their fearless trek into the unknown that
        often wins the day. Aries is a bundle of energy and dynamism (the quality of being characterized
        by vigorous activity and progress), kind of like a Pied Piper (a person who entices people to follow
        them, especially to their doom), leading people along with its
        charm and charisma.

      Symbol: The Ram

        Pros and Cons: Impulsive aries might be tempted to ram their ideas down everyone's throats without bothering to ask
        if they want to know. You're not likely to convince the Ram to soften up; these folks are blunt and to the point.
        Along with those qualities comes the sheer force of the Aries nature, a force that can actually accomplish a great deal.

        Much of Aries' drive to compete and to win comes from its Cardinal Quality (). Cardinal Signs () love to get things going,
        and Aries exemplifies this better than Cancer (link), Libra (link), or Capricorn (link).

      Ruling Planet: Mars

        Looking at Roman mythology, we find that Mars was the God of War. Our man Mars was unafraid to do battle, and much the same can be said for Aries.

      Element: Fire

        Think action, enthusiasm and a burning desire to play the game. Aries love physicality, so they won't sit on the sidelines for long, if at all.
        They'll jump into the fray full force and will conttribute much in the process. Sure, some of their decisions may later prove to have been hasty,
        but you'll never find an aries who regretted taking a shot.
