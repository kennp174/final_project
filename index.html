			<h2><a href="project.html">Phoebe Kennedy Project</a></h2>
			<p>Brief description of the project. I want to make an interactive site/game where the user travels through and can explore space.

				What is your motiviation for making it?
				I love astrology and the stars and found a site I love that was a big part of my inspiration.
				I also would like to learn more about the stars and find the topic interesting.

				What do you want the audience to take away from it?
				I want them to have fun with the interactive aspects/game but also feel like they have learned something, even if it is just one detail.I don't want
				it to be too scientific that it only appeals to those who intensly study the topic.

				What do you want them to feel, learn, or think about?
				I want it to feel as if they are floating with the stars and learning about the stars/planets.

			<p> 1. Enter birthday / sign (aries, leo, libra etc)
					2. Astrological star chart shows - can user place it in its proper place in the sky?
					3. Can you place all the constellations?
					4. Once they are placed it will zoom in on one star that is actually a planet (or their star signs)
					5. Can you name all the planets (match)
					6. Once all are named everything in the browser gets sucked into a black hole (moves forward like Ellie Goulding lights example)
					7. Once through user is able to use the mouse to explore space (like the star site)
